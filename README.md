# single_player_ludo_game
Single player ludo game, developed in C++ is a simplified version of the famous ludo game, which can be played using the terminal. It gives the player a chance to play with the computer. The player is rolling a dice and must roll 6 to start the game or to take out a new token on the board. Instead of other players, there are traps introduced along the way, which brings the player back to its normal position.
